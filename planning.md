<h1>Planning.md</h1>
The purpose of this portfolio is to inform the reader on biotechnology
<br>
<br>
The target audience is anyone interested in biotechnology or science in general
<br>
<h3>What is on each page and why</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>index.html:</strong> <em>Biotechnology summary and core concepts:</em> To introduce the topic to the reader</li>
  <li><strong>page2.html:</strong> <em>Key areas and examples:</em> To demonstrate the utility of the material and how it works</li>
  <li><strong>page3.html:</strong> <em>Modern techniques:</em> To show where the field is at now and where it could be going</li>
</ol>
The navigation structure that I chose is to link to the next page at the bottom of the current page. This was done to encourage the reader to continue through the website linearly.
<br>
<h3>4 HTML tags I plan to use effectively</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>br tag:</strong> I'm using this tag as it is key to splitting up the site into sections</li>
  <li><strong>ul tag:</strong> This tag is effective in displaying lists in bullet points so that they can be read easier</li>
  <li><strong>heading tag:</strong> This is used many times as a title to put structure on the information</li>
  <li><strong>anchor tag:</strong> This is used to link the web pages together which is obviously crucial</li>
</ul>
